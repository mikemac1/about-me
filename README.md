# LAB - 2/3

## About Me

This site is a biography that gives some interaction between the user and site to gain insight about myself. The site has five 'Yes" or 'No" questions using JS' prompt() that will provide specifics about me the developer.
Added 2 additional quesitons which plays a game of sorts. One is guessing a number, the second is guessing an item in an array. Also some content was added to the HTML side with a list of 10 items.

### Reflections and Comments For Lab 2

* Today's lab went okay. I found today that using the console log is a great way to troubleshoot the conditionals for the appropriate responses. The CSS work is a work in progress for sure.  I don't see myself becoming a CSS expert as I just don't see the colors working together despite trying the Adobe color wheel picker.
* So far no questions. The pace is going really well and I have been able to understand the work at hand as the pre-assignment reading has made it very easy to keep pace with the instructor.
* The assignment required about 90 minutes to get the majority of the work done when I started in the middle of lunch. Working on the CSS portion could take me all day as I play with the box model's appropriate settings to make it work.
* I didn't have to utilize any tools for the JS or HTML portion and this was the first time implementing the reset file from Eric Meyers which I noted in my ReadMe file. I did use the Adobe color wheel picker but I just don't have the ability yet to pick complimentary colors and make it work...

### Reflections and Comments For Lab 3

* Today was a disaster. After working on this for 6 hours I finally got the last question working in the JS portion. I feel like a failure. I really felt like I understood the fundamentals of loops and come to find out when I applied for today's lab I do not.
* The only reason why I was able to finish was the T/A had me add a boolean flag that "acts like a switch" to use one portion of the loop versus another. I have no frigging idea what that means or why it works but now it works.
* I feel like such a fake. I have code currently in my JS and no clue why or how it works.  If this is the way I am supposed to feel on day 3 of week 1 this is going to be a long four weeks.
* I think I made a major mistake signing up for this course as I have almost no confidence going forward.
