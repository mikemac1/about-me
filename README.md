### Reflections and Comments

* Today's lab went okay. I found today that using the console log is a great way to troubleshoot the conditionals for the appropriate responses. The CSS work is a work in progress for sure.  I don't see myself becoming a CSS expert as I just don't see the colors working together despite trying the Adobe color wheel picker.
* So far no questions. The pace is going really well and I have been able to understand the work at hand as the pre-assignment reading has made it very easy to keep pace with the instructor.
* The assignment required about 90 minutes to get the majority of the work done when I started in the middle of lunch. Working on the CSS portion could take me all day as I play with the box model's appropriate settings to make it work.
* I didn't have to utilize any tools for the JS or HTML portion and this was the first time implementing the reset file from Eric Meyers which I noted in my ReadMe file. I did use the Adobe color wheel picker but I just don't have the ability yet to pick complimentary colors and make it work...
